Summary:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As mentioned in the high-level requirements we created this project, Perigo is a web interface meant to help facilitate the buying and
selling of goods online. Members who have an account with the site are able to add listings and view listings. Individuals that are not
members are able to view listings but not add.

Sellers are able to have their items bid on for a week and the person who has the highest bid at the end is the winner of the auction.
Buyers can bid on items or pay a fixed price, depending on the seller's preference. Both of these functionalities are supported in
the site.

People who are logged in to the site are able to keep a list of "saved items" that they can go back to if they want to revisit certain
items they saw. This function works and can be seen on both the product and browse pages of the site.
